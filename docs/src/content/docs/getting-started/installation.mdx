---

## Requirements

Before installing Valicomb, ensure your environment meets these requirements:

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- `ext-mbstring` extension (for multibyte string support)

### Optional Extensions

- `ext-bcmath` is recommended for high-precision numeric comparisons with `min`/`max` validators

## Install via Composer

Install Valicomb using Composer:

```bash
composer require frostybee/valicomb
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, you can verify it works by creating a simple validation:

```php
<?php

require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Frostybee\Valicomb\Validator;

$v = new Validator(['email' => 'test@example.com']);
$v->rule('email', 'email');

if ($v->validate()) {
    echo "Valicomb is working correctly!";
}
```
