description: Install and set up Valicomb, a simple and modern PHP validation library
---

**Valicomb** is a simple, minimal PHP validation library with **zero dependencies**. Completely rewritten for PHP 8.2+ with security-first design, strict type safety, and modern PHP features.

:::note
This is a modernized and actively maintained fork of [vlucas/valitron](https://github.com/vlucas/valitron)
:::

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- `ext-mbstring` extension

## Installation

Install Valicomb using Composer:

```bash
composer require frostybee/valicomb
```

## Optional Extensions

- For high-precision numeric comparisons, consider installing the [BCMath](http://us3.php.net/manual/en/book.bc.php) extension. If you are comparing floating-point numbers with `min`/`max` validators, BCMath provides greater accuracy and reliability. Valicomb will automatically use it if available.

## Features

- **Modern PHP 8.2+ support** with strict types turned on, so everything is fully typed and predictable.
- **Security-first approach** that helps guard against things like ReDoS, type juggling issues, path traversal, and similar problems.
- **Thoroughly tested**, with over 430 tests making sure things behave the way they should.
- **No external dependencies**, other than the standard `ext-mbstring` extension.
- **Clean and straightforward API** that's easy to read and chain together.
- **Built-in i18n support**, offering 22 languages out of the box.
- **53 ready-to-use validation rules** covering the most common validation needs.
- **Easy to extend**, so you can add your own custom validation rules when needed.
- **Clean, modern codebase**, fully passing PHPStan Level 8 checks.


## Quick Example

```php
use Frostybee\Valicomb\Validator;

$v = new Validator(['email' => 'test@example.com', 'age' => '25']);
$v->rule('required', ['email', 'age']);
$v->rule('email', 'email');
$v->rule('integer', 'age');

if ($v->validate()) {
    echo "Validation passed!";
} else {
    print_r($v->errors());
}
```
